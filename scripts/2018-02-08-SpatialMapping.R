# using united_states data
## Week Challenge

# 1. Create a new object called us_states_name that contains only the NAME column from the us_states object. What is the class of the new object and what makes it geographic?

#2. Select columns from the us_states object which contain population data. Obtain the same result using a different command (bonus: try to find three ways of obtaining the same result). Hint: try to use helper functions, such as contains or starts_with from dplyr (see ?contains).

# 3. Find all states with the following characteristics (bonus find and plot them):
#   - Belong to the Midwest region.
#   - Belong to the West region, have an area below 250,000 km2 and in 2015 a population greater than 5,000,000 residents (hint: you may need to use the function units::set_units() or as.numeric()).
#   - Belong to the South region, had an area larger than 150,000 km2 or a total population in 2015 larger than 7,000,000 residents.
# 4. What was the total population in 2015 in the us_states dataset? What was the minimum and maximum total population in 2015?
# 5. How many states are there in each region?
# 6. What was the minimum and maximum total population in 2015 in each region? What was the total population in 2015 in each region?
# 7. Add variables from us_states_df to us_states, and create a new object called us_states_stats. What function did you use and why? Which variable is the key in both datasets? What is the class of the new object?
# 8. us_states_df has two more rows than us_states. How can you find them? (hint: try to use the dplyr::anti_join() function)
# 9. What was the population density in 2015 in each state? What was the population density in 2010 in each state?
# 10. How much has population density changed between 2010 and 2015 in each state? Calculate the change in percentages and map them.

# 11. Change the columnsâ€™ names in us_states to lowercase. (Hint: helper functions - tolower() and colnames() may help.)
# 12. Using us_states and us_states_df create a new object called us_states_sel. The new object should have only two variables - median_income_15 and geometry. Change the name of the median_income_15 column to Income.
# 13. Calculate the change in median income between 2010 and 2015 for each state. Bonus: What was the minimum, average and maximum median income in 2015 for each region? What is the region with the largest increase of the median income?
